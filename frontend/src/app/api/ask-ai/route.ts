  'solar flare': {
    answer: "A solar flare is like a giant explosion on the Sun! It happens when magnetic energy stored in the Sun's atmosphere suddenly gets released. Think of it like a rubber band snapping - all that stored energy bursts out as bright light and particles that zoom through space!",
    followUp: "What would you like to know next - how solar flares affect Earth, how we detect them, or what causes them?",
    interestingFact: "Solar flares can be as powerful as billions of hydrogen bombs exploding at once!",
    recommendation: {
      title: "Explore our Real-Time Space Weather Dashboard",
      link: "/learn"
    }
  },
  'aurora': {
    answer: "Auroras (Northern and Southern Lights) are like nature's own light show! They happen when tiny particles from the Sun crash into Earth's invisible magnetic shield and light up our atmosphere. It's like cosmic fireworks painting the sky in green, blue, and sometimes red colors!",
    followUp: "Want to learn more about - aurora colors, aurora sounds, or where to see them?",
    interestingFact: "Auroras occur about 60-250 miles above Earth - that's higher than where airplanes fly!",
    recommendation: {
      title: "See Aurora Stories in our Time Travel feature",
      link: "/time-travel"
    }
  },
  'geomagnetic storm': {
    answer: "A geomagnetic storm is when Earth's magnetic field gets all shaken up by solar wind! Imagine Earth has an invisible bubble around it (our magnetosphere), and sometimes the Sun sends strong winds that make this bubble wobble and compress. This can affect satellites, power grids, and create beautiful auroras!",
    followUp: "Which effect interests you most - impacts on technology, effects on animals, or historical storms?",
    interestingFact: "During strong geomagnetic storms, auroras can be seen as far south as Florida!",
    recommendation: {
      title: "Check out our Space Weather Stories",
      link: "/stories"
    }
  },
  'carrington event': {
    answer: "The Carrington Event of 1859 was the most powerful geomagnetic storm in recorded history! It was so strong that telegraph wires sparked, some caught fire, and auroras were seen as far south as the Caribbean. Telegraph operators got electric shocks, but some could still send messages using just the storm's electricity!",
    followUp: "Want to explore - what caused it, how people survived it, or what would happen if it occurred today?",
    interestingFact: "During the Carrington Event, some telegraph lines worked without any power source - just using the storm's energy!",
    recommendation: {
      title: "Time Travel to the Carrington Event",
      link: "/time-travel"
    }
  },
  'satellite': {
    answer: "Space weather can be tricky for satellites! Solar storms can make satellites tumble, damage their electronics, or even knock them out of their orbits. It's like trying to fly a paper airplane in a windstorm - the space 'weather' pushes them around!",
    followUp: "Learn more about - how satellites protect themselves, famous satellite failures, or how we track space debris?",
